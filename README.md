# 🦀 Learning Rust

A collection of small Rust projects built to practice core language concepts and project
structure through hands-on implementation.

Each project lives in its own directory and is documented independently. Projects may be
revisited and refined as understanding deepens.

## Focus

- Rust fundamentals and idiomatic patterns
- Clear, readable, and maintainable code
- Thoughtful project structure
- Writing code that can be explained and reasoned about
